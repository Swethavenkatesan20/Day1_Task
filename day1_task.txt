TASK 1:
Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

The purpose of HTTP is to establish connection between the 
client and server. 
Client is basically a browser and server probably cloud. 
The connection between client and server is done by request response


PROCESS

      => The HTTP request from client is sent to server tcp connection is established 
      => The server gets the request and runs application 
      => Server returns HTTP response to browser 

For the above process due to limitation HTTP version was established 

HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 2

In HTTP1.1 when the connection is established the request is sent to server only 
after the response from server to client another request can be made. 
In parallel six TCP connection can be sent. 

This makes longer to load and impact performance of the browser 
To overcome this in HTTP2 a single secure TCP connection is established 
were streams are created and HTTP request is sent as stream. 

This makes browser fast no need to wait for response and wait for new TCP connection.
In HTTP1.1 the header is sent with each request to overcome this 
in HTTP2 HPACK was introduced to separate header and plain text. 
This comprise the header avoids redundancy.
   








TASK 2: 
      
 Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

OBJECTS : 

We know what variables is, variable is used to store Data.
Objects are similar to variables but here we can store multile data.

FOR EXAMPLE :  

var a="guvi";                              //Declaring variable, here we are storing value 

var obj={
name:"swe",
course:"fullstack"}                        //Declaring object, here also we are storing values but we can store multiple values. 


OBJECT Representation

var obj=key:value;                              // syntax

key should always be string or symbol 
We can access object by objectName.key or objectName[key]

EXAMPLE: 
var details={
location:"chennai",
college:"panimalar",
department:"computer science"
}
console.log(details.college)                 // accessing object 
details.year=2020                            // adding property to object
